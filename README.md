# LetterCraze
A puzzle game with different modes, where the general feel is a mix between Scrabble and a word search.

## How to Play
The LetterCraze game consists of a sequence of levels, each of which must be completed in order. In general,
the objective of the game is to form words with at least 3 letters by dragging your mouse over tiles which form a word. However,
there are three different types of levels that are included, each of which has a different goal.

### Puzzle Round
Goal: Form words with the highest value. This involves finding longer words, or words using less common letters.
Limit: You can only create a limit amount of words. Once you have reached the limit, you won't be able to find
any more words unless you restart the level.

### Lightning Round
Goal: Form the most number of words. The length and complexity don't matter, so try to form short words.
Limit: You will only be able to find words for a defined amount of time. Once the timer runs out, you won't
be able to find any more words unless you restart the level.

### Theme Level
Goal: Find the words that are in the theme. The words are predefined, so you can only find words that the creator
considered to be apart of the theme.
Limit: You will only be able to find a specified number of words. The tiles in this level don't regenerate.
